# Answer the following questions for Zillow assignment
1. Which models did you try, and how did they compare? If you only tried 
one model, why did you choose this model?
	- I used a neural network that was specific to regresion tasks. I selected the 
	MLP Regressor from sklearn for this task. It was easier to train than the xgboost 
	regressor that I tried and seemed to perform relatively well. I chose this model as 
	it was recommended when I searched "neural network regression algorithms."

2. Choose three numeric fields and examine the distribution of those 
fields. Based on your observations, what kind of distribution did you 
find, and what steps would you take, if any, to prepare the data in 
those fields?

3. What was your final score, and what steps would you attribute to 
improving your score during data preparation, model selection, or 
parameter tuning?

If you used AI assistants such as Copilot & ChapGPT:
- Which AI tools did you use and for what part of the solution?
- Optional: share any reflection on using such tools. For instance, did  
hey contribute to your learning? Were they more helpful than harmful? 
Did you notice any mistakes in their outputs?
